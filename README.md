## Technologies Used
- Java language


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Solving linear systems of equations using Gauss, Gauss-Jordan, Inverse, and Cramer methods
- Solving determinants using Cofactor and Inverse matrix methods
- Making inverse matrices using Gauss elimination and Adjoint matrix methods
- Solving interpolation problems
- Solving double regression problems




## How to run our matrix calculator?
(if already compiled go to step 3)
1. Go to src folder
2. Compile all source code files with this command: `javac -d ..\bin Matrix/*.java Algorithm/*.java Utility/*.java Main/*.java`
3. Go to bin folder
4. Run the Main.Main program using the command : `java Main.Main`
